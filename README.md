# :robot: Lab - Final Project for Robotics Engineering (Fall)

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

For your final assignment of the Fall Semeseter we will be combining many of the concepts you have already learned.  You will design and construct (possibly) a machine thet responds to temperature change by moving a lever at a controlled velocity until a limit switch is triggered.  This might be something similiar to a door on a cooling system opening when needed and stopping once its limit is reached in order to protect the motor and other parts. This project may be done with one partner if you choose (or you can do this on your own).  If you choose to work with a partner, both of you still need to submit all of the requirements.  üöÄ

## Part One - Logic Gates
Design a system using any logic gates of your choice as long they accomplish ALL of the following:

### - Turn on a motor (through a MOSFET)
  - From a slide switch (SPDT), *AND*
  - A thermistor (connected through 220 resistor), *AND* 
  - Turn it off with a limit switch

## Part Two - Mechanical System

### Assuming a 125 RPM motor is being used and a ___ mm channel as seen here, design a set of driver and driven gears, pulleys or sprockets which accomplish the follwoing:

- Change the velocity of the end of a lever to 80 m/s +- 5% using only gears, pulleys and sprockets we have in the lab.

## Optional - Extra Credit

### Build this working machine

### Procedures

1. Write out all of your work on graph paper so that it is clearly communicated.  
2. Take a photo of your work and upload it here.
3. Create a file callled "results.md" and explain all of your work.

## üìù Next steps (Graded)


*Extra Credit Option*

Build a system that accomplishes all of the above requirements and demonstrate it by the end of our finals period.

## üìö  Resources 

You should spend time with all of our class resources including the class online text and any other resources that will be useful in completing this assignment.
