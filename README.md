# :robot: Lab - Final Project for Robotics Engineering (Fall)

## ðŸ¤“ Overview and learning outcomes 

For your final assignment of the Fall Semeseter we will be combining many of the concepts you have already learned.  You will design and construct (possibly) a machine thet responds to temperature change by moving a lever at a controlled velocity until a limit switch is triggered.  This might be something similiar to a door on a cooling system opening when needed and stopping once its limit is reached in order to protect the motor and other parts. This project may be done with one partner if you choose (or you can do this on your own).  If you choose to work with a partner, both of you still need to submit all of the requirements.  ðŸš€

## Part One - Logic Gates
Design a system using any logic gates of your choice as long they accomplish ALL of the following:

### - Turn on a motor (through a MOSFET)
  - From a slide switch (SPDT), *AND*
  - A [thermistor](https://www.amazon.com/01M1002JF-Thermistor-2-Pin-Radial-Items/dp/B09T5PW1NY) (connected through a ~500 Ohm resistor), *AND* 
  - Turn it off with a limit switch

## Part Two - Mechanical System

### Assuming a 125 RPM motor and a 200mm channel as a lever, design a set of driver and driven gears, pulleys or sprockets which accomplish the follwoing:

- Change the velocity of the end of a lever to 80 m/s +- 5% using only gears, pulleys and sprockets we have in the lab.

## Optional - Extra Credit

### Build this working machine

- This will require extensive testing since you will need to make sure the resistor on the thermistor above may not be adequate to hit the upper range for registering a TRUE value on your IC gate.  Also, the mechanical side will need to be fully constructed.

### Procedures

1. Write out all of your work on graph paper so that it is clearly communicated.  Take a photo of your work and upload it here.
2. Design your mechanical system in Onshape using what you have learned about assemblies.  You do not need to build the entire system, just the gears attached to a channel with a channel for the lever attached to the final driven gear.
3. Create a file callled "results.md" and explain all of your work.  Link the assembly you have created in OnShape in this file. Insert your photo(s) of your graph paper solution.

## ðŸ“š  Resources 

You should spend time with all of our class resources including the class online text and any other resources that will be useful in completing this assignment.
