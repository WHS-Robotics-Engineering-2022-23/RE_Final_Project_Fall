# :robot: Lab - Final Project for Robotics Engineering (Fall)

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

For your final assignment of the Fall Semeseter we will be combining many of the concepts you have already learned.  You will design and construct  . This project may be done with one partner if you choose (or you can do this on your own).  If you choose to work with a partner, both of you still need to submit all of the requirements.  🚀

## Part One - Logic Gates
Design a system using any logic gates of your choice as long they accomplish ALL of the following:

- 

## Part Two - Mechanical System
Assuming a 125 RPM motor is being used and a ___ mm channel as seen here, design a set of driver and driven gears, pulleys or sprockets which accomplish the follwoing:

- Reduce the velocity of the end of the bar to ___ m/s.


### Procedures

1. Write out all of your work on graph paper so that it is clearly communicated.  
2. Take a photo of your work and upload it here.
3. Create a file callled "results.md" and explain all of your work.

## 📝 Next steps (Graded)


*Extra Credit Option*

Build a system that accomplishes all of the above requirements and demonstrate it by the end of our finals period.
