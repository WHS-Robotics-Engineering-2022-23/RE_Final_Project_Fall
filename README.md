# :robot: Lab - Final Project for Robotics Engineering (Fall)

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

For your final assignment of the Fall Semesete we will be combining many of the concepts you have already learned.  You will design and construct  . This project may be done with one partner if you choose (or you can do this on your own).  If you choose to work with a partner, both of you still need to submit all of the requirements.  üöÄ

## Part One - Logic Gates
Design a system using any logic gates of your choice as long they accomplish ALL of the following:

## Part Two - Design a Mechanical System

## Lab Setup

1. Set the power supply to 3V and turn off the power supply.
2. Attach the wheel to the DC motor hub.
3. Attatch the hub to the motor shaft.
4. Mark the wheel with Sharpie to give a reference point for measuring RPMs.
5. Connect your DC motor to the power supply using the aligator clips.

While the power supply is off, take a photo of the motor connected to the power supply.  Later, you will upload that photo to this lab.

### Procedures

1. 

## üìù Next steps (Graded)

Answer the following questions in a markdown file titiled, "observations.md":

1. What is the general relationship between voltage and RPMs in a DC motor?
2. Would you describe this relationship as linear?  Explain.
3. What statement would you use to accurately describe the relationship between these two variables?

Insert the photo from earlier into the .md file and a screenshot of your chart.

## üìö  Resources 

You should spend time with all of our class resources including the class online text and any other resources that will be useful in completing this assignment.
